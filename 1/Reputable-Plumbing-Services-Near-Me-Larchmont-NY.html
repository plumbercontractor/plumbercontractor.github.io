<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
