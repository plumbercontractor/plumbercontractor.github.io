<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Many property owner install gas lines for gas ranges, heating systems, fireplaces or other gas operable devices in the house. Gas lines provide the natural energy source to the house safely. Gas lines need to fulfill particular specifications to ensure that there are no gas leakages that may be hazardous to the residents. The service technician needs to ensure that the pipes are developed to correctly provide gas to the home.</p>

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
