The California Plumbing License Exam is required in order to work as a licensed contractor in California Any person who means to work as a plumbing contractor that is accountable for building, changing, or fixing a building or structure needs to be licensed.

<h3>Sink Leaking in Algonquin Illinois</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
