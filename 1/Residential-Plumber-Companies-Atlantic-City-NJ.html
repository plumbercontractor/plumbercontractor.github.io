<p>If you've always resided in an area with tough water, you might not realize how much it affects you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>

<p>Some softeners deal with electrical energy, but some more recent water softeners use waterpower.

When the water is very hard and it is used greatly, the expenses of softening will rise.</p>
