<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and readily available for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion, request that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
