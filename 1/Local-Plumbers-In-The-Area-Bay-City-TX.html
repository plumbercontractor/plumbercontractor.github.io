<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of keeping the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is one other vital component required to make the procedure work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Gas is tough to discover, as it's a colorless, odorless substance. We use gas in our homes with gas ovens, heaters, and stoves.

At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Tough water triggers a greater threat of lime scale deposits in household water supply. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is minimized. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent.
