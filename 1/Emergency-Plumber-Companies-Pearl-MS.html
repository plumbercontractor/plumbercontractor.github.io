<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
