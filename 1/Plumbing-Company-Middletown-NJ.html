When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
