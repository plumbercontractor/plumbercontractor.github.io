<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Jackson NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally unusual cases where the building is considered to not posture a danger to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
