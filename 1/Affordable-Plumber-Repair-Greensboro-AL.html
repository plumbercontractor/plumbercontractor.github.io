<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
