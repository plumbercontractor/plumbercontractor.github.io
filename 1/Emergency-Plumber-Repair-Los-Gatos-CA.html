<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water system and distribution pipes are typically found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for brand-new building residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly costly, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
