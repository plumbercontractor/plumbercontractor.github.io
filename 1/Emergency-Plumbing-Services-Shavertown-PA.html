<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough job because of the age of your house and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
