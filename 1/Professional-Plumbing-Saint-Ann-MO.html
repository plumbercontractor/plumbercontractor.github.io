Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>When it pertains to fixing a broken or failing sewer line, there are a couple of options. The right choice for your house will depend upon a few elements, consisting of the age of your existing pipes, the level of damage, and your spending plan.
