<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home.

The info we glean from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and advise the best solution too. If the pipe requires to be cleaned up of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the perfect recommendation with confidence.</p>

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
