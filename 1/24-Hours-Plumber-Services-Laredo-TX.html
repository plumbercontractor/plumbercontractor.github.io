<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
