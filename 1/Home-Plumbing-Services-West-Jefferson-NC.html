<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance West Jefferson NC</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than items containing harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
