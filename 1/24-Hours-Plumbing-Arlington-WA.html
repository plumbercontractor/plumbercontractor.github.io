<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter season freezing.
