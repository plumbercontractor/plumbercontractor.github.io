<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the plumbing in older buildings can fail. When the pipes begin to wear away, it impacts your water supply. Infected water is a health danger and should be dealt with quickly. Rust can also break, break, or burst pipes and destroy your walls or floors. We correct little leakages without repiping, but if you experience persistent leakage or a slab leak, it may be time for a complete plumbing overhaul.</p>
