It is extremely hard to judge such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well adequate explained to allow others to assess them and to verify the outcomes. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it needs to make one think twice to accept it without some warranty of performance.</p>
<p>Toilets are difficult things to know. They have actually been constructed practically the same way for centuries, so you can't really inform how old they are. It might not work extremely well all the time, but you can't inform if that's normal or not.
