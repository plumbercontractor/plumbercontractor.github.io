<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of keeping the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
