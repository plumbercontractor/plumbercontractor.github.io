Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a brief life.
