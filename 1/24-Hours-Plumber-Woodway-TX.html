<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent performance of research, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. Examining the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your home should have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working properly, you are off to a great start.</p>
