<p>While not every state requires insurance before contractor licenses are released, having your own warranties the safety of your service.

To be safe instead of sorry, getting the best insurance for your plumbing company serves as a defense against monetary threats and company jeopardies.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable solution, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
