<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
