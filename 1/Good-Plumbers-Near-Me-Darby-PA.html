<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
