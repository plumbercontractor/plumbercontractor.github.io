The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't an excellent idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been specifically designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight equally and could ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
