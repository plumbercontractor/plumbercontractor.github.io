Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire battling or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction impact and draw possible impurities into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply.
