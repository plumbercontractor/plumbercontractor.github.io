It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
