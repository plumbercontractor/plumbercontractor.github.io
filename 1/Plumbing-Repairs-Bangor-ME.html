Check valve assembly (DCV) and decreased pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most frequently utilized in commercial facilities.</p>

The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
