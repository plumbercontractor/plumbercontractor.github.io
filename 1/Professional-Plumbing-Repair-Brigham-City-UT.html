<p>Your garbage disposal installation requires to be carried out by a professional plumber if you desire it to work well for several years to come. It is a fairly easy device that draws food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that turns at high speeds, which pulverizes the scraps.

If you have a duel drain setup, it usually takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
