<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of firmness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health.
