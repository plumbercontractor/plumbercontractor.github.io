<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
