<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Typically handles are toilet parts that get loose or corroded and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back appropriately. It's an easy repair, but there's a trick to getting the flush deal with out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Image 1). Then get rid of the old deal with and lever, slide the new handle into place, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
