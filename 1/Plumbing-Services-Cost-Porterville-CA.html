The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not disperse your weight equally and might eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
