When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. The pipes typically make weird gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe since of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, resulting in the strange sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
