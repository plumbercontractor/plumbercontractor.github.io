<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
