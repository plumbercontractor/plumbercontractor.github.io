The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water main.

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
