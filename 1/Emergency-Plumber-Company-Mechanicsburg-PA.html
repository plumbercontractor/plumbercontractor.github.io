<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
