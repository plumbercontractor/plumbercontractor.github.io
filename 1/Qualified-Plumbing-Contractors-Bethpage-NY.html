<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
