<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Stanwood WA</h3>
<p>Defective plumbing and fixtures can be more than a problem: It can cost you cash in increased water expenses and cause structural damage to your home. 10 percent of homes nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Fixing those leakages can conserve you 10 percent on your water expenses each year.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a residence is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and pretty inexpensive to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, eventually triggering a backup.
