<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>A skilled plumber like Matt Mertz Plumbing, Inc. can assist you decide when it's time to replace your pipes. As piping installation and repair professionals, we can fix problems or explain when it will be safer or more cost-efficient to just redo your piping system.
