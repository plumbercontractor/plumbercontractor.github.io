<p>Water temperature level problems can be fixed by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen.

<p>In truth, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.
