That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Each location where you will have a gas appliance need to have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, any person who installs gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership must have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a license and inspection.</p>
