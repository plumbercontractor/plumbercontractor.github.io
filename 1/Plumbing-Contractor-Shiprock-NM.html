Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
