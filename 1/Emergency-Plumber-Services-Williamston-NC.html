<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly.
