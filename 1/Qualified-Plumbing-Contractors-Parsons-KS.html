<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician turned off the water system and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The consumer assisted our service technician in moving the toilet back into its proper area, and the technician tightened up the bolts before restoring the water system and guaranteeing that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>
<p>If you are considering installing a new water heater, think of going tankless. Garbage disposals should use a grounded outlet for power.
