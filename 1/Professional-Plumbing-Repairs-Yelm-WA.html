<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
