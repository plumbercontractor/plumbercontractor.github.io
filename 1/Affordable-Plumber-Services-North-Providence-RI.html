Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
