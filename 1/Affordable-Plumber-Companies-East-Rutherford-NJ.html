It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>

The field test may not constantly show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair set are required. There may be additional test procedures, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can supply information revealing the severity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
