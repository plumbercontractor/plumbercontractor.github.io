In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
