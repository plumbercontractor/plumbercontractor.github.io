<p>Numerous property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their filthy or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are easy to utilize and economical, but they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently.
