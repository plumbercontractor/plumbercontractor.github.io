<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>
<p>Except for domestic pump and pump and irrigation systems, certification is not required to install plumbing systems beyond a structure (e.g., water lines connected directly to municipal water pipe, sewer line connections, etc.).
