Camera are useful in locating buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out appropriate maintenance schedules or the level of essential repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he might play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in really bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>

Cooking Grease: Cooking grease ought to never ever be tossed down the kitchen drain. While it might go down as a liquid, as it cools it can become solid, finishing your pipes in the process.

<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This average life expectancy computation presumes typical wear and tear of the system.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
