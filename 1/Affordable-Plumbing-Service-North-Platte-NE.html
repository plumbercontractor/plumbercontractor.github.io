<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for many building and construction contractors (or their workers). The secret to the technology is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, however its steep cost makes it impractical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in many cases, contain phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>
