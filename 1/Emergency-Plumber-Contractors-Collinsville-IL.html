The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
