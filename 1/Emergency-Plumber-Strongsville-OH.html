Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
