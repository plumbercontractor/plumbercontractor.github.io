The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

<p>The normal service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
