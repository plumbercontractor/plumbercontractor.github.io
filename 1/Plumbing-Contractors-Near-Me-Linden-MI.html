<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building and construction of a new or remodelled structure is installed by educated craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes fixture itself. Blockages in a component can cause harmful damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly must be checked to identify what needs repair. The field test might not always show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair set are necessary. There may be additional test procedures, beyond those developed in the tester accreditation program, that can provide information showing the intensity of the failure that might help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
