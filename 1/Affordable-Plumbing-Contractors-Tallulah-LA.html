<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
