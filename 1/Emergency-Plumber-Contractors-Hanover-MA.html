The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
