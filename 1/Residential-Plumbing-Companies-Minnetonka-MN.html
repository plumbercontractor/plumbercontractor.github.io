<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Minnetonka MN</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
