The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
