<p>Numerous homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or filthy drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to eat away at the clog and with duplicated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper safety measures.</p>
