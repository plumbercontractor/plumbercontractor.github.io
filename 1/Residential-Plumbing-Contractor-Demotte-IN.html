When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix.

All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and determine problem. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially helpful in finding an issue.</p>
