<p>Remember that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you ought to only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture moisture so that it doesn't get in the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment might survive a drip leg.</p>
