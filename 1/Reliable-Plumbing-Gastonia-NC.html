<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not effectively protected.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
