<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
