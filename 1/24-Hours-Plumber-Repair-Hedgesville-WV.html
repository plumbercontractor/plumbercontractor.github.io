<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities.
