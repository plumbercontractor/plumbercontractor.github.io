Others carry bags of rocks for putting in the house traps or cleanouts so they are guaranteed future stoppages in the line.

<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
