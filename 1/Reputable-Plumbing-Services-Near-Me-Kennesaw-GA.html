<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
