<h3>Blocked Sewer in Breaux Bridge LA 70517 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
