<h3>Water Tank Repair in Fort Thomas Kentucky</h2>
<p>If the toilet can not be fixed, or if the repair cost methods replacement cost, we'll discuss your choices. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular approach of clearing clogs.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
