Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
