<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
