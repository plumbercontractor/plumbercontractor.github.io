<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of products to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be assessed. The installation needs to be examined to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data need to be collected to figure out the workings of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be checked again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow chart is needed to guarantee it was fixed correctly. A properly repaired assembly needs to supply years of defense.</p>

<p>You most likely understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your bath tubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working correctly that's really all you need to learn about them, but when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the expertise to identify a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
