<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you need to only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch moisture so that it does not enter the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
