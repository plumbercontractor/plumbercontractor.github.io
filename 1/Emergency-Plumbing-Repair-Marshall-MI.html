<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water supply. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
