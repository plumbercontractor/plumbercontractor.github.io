<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>New designs of waste disposal unit might need to be hard-wired into a devoted electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't readily available in an older house, working with an electrical contractor to add a circuit costs around $150-$ 250. The drain line is clogged: If your kitchen sink clogs, never use chemical drain cleaner! Rather, call a plumber to clear the clog and locate without damaging your garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company supplies include check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and decreased pressure zone assemblies. Pointer: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. When you attach the P-trap, also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
<p>Repiping a house takes 3 to five days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood advises examining the qualifications of different companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They stay the least pricey and most efficient way to rid your water of problematic minerals.</p>
