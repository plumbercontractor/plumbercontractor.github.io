<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
