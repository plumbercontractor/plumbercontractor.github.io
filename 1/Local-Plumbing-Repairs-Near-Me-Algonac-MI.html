<p>Lots of homeowners think their utility companies or homeowners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that in many cases you, the house owner, are responsible.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one instructions.

Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
