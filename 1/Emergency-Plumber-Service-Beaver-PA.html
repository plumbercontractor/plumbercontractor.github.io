<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

A toilet's tank is composed of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts break, they result in tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part.
