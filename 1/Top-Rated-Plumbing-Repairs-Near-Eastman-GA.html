<p>One typical way for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread significantly if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
