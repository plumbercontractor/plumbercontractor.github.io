<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Calimesa CA</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Installed under the kitchen sink, a garbage disposal uses sharp blades and a motor to grind (and virtually liquefy) food waste so it can flow down through the drains and into the sewer system.
