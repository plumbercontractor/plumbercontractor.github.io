<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
