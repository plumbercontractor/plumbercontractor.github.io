<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if utilizing one of these items.</p>
