<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this could be an indicator that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and might start leaking quickly. You can look at this by filling a number of five-gallon containers with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a water heater replacement.</p>
