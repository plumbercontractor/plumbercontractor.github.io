<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines.
