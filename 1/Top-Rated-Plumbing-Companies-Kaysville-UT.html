<h3>Sump Pump Installation in Kaysville Utah</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
