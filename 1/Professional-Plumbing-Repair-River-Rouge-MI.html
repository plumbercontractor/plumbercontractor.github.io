<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

Tough water causes these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any problems with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks much easier and less annoying for everybody included.</p>
