<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions.
