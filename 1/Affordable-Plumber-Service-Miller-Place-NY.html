It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly.

Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
