<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
