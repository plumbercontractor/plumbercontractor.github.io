If your DIY dig hits a gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a threat of fire or surge damage to your property or your next-door neighbor's. Another danger in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too essential to risk in a Do It Yourself sewer project! Avoid these security hazards by working with a professional plumber.</p>
