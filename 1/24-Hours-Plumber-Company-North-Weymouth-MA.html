Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>When a gas line is ruptured, it immediately ends up being a serious security hazard. Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it could cause quite a bit of damage if the natural gas inside becomes sparked.
