<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more.
