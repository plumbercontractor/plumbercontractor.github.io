The pipe lining procedure involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and flaws. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
