<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you must probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
