<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened).

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
