<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into scenarios, quite often that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task.

I 'd like to post some photos of this. Just look on line. The issue does exist.</p>

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
