<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create severe drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to repair the problem and discover for normal house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it results in further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
