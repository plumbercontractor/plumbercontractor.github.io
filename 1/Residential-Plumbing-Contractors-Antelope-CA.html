<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
