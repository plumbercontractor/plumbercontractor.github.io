<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
