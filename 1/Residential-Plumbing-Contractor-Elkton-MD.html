<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through.

Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
