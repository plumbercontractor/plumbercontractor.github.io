<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
