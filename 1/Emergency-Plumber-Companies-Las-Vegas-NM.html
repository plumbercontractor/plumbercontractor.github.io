<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and stable  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should likewise check to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
