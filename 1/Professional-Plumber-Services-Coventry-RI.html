<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
