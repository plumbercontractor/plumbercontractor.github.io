<p>If you notice low water pressure or blemished water, it typically represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.

Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
