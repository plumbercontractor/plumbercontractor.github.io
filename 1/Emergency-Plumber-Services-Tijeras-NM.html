<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws caused by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls effectively. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>
