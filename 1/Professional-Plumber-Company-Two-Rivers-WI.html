Inspecting the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in the house must have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. If whatever is working effectively, you are off to a good start.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save cash. While this might work in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same product as other pipes in your home, meaning that difficulty might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
