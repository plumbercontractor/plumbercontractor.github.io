The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anyone who inhales it needs immediate medical attention.

To avoid this disaster, make certain to utilize your gas ranges exactly as instructed and never ever to use them to heat your home. The exact same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors just and not inside. When running the space-heaters, make certain someone is awake to monitor them.
