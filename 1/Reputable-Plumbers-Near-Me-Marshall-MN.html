<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
