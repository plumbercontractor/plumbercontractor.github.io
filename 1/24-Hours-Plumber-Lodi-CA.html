<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
