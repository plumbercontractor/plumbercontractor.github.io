<p>Backpressure might happen when the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly safeguarded, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which may carry unclean water or other, harmful compounds into the public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a number of scenarios that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
