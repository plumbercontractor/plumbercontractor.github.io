<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Warm water is no longer a high-end-- it's a requirement.

Call Plumbing by Jake.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
