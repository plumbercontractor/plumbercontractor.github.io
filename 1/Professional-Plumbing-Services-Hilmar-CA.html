<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
