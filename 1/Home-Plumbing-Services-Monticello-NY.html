Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
