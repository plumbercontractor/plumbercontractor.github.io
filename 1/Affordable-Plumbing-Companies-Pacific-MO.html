<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is manually controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the service technician to accurately examine conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the best solution too. We can make the ideal suggestion with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
