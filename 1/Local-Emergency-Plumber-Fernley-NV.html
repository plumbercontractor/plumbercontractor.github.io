<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
