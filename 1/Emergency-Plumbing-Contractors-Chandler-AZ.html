This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that hazard, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking.
