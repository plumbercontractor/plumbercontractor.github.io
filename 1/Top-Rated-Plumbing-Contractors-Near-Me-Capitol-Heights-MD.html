<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
