<p>Clogged toilets are among the most common plumbing concerns plumbers deal with, and for lots of people, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop.

<p>Plumbers typically start as apprentices. From there, they evaluate and make a journey plumbing license, and eventually be granted a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground no for obstructions. As hair combines with soap, it can produce the perfect storm for plumbing obstructions. In time, these obstructions can intensify and prevent your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures if using among these items.</p>
