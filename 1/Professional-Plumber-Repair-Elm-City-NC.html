<p>These branching distribution pipelines form networks and loops including water mains and supply pipelines. Water mains range in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines provide water for whole areas in addition to large commercial, residential and industrial complexes. Depending on the flow capability, location and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a variety of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter strengthened concrete.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally sodium. Salt will not trigger lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
