<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
