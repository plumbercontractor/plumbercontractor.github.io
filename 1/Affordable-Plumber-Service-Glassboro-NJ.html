<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Glassboro New Jersey</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
