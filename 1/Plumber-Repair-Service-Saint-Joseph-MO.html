<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is an invention that mimics biomineralization, the system typically acknowledged for structured development in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely eliminate momentary solidity in water.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>
