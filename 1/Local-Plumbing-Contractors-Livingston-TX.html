All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service organisation need to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're great.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
