<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break.

Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
