Because they immediately heat water, there is no need to shop currently heated water and they provide an endless amount of warm water, which suggests you will never run out of warm water. If you are the last in the family to get a shower, even. While they cost a bit more upfront, they can save you money with time because you aren't using energy to continually keep a tank of water hot.</p>
