<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Los Altos CA 94024</h3>
<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We determine what is wrong with your hot water heater, as well as what maintenance work needs to be carried out progressing. Water softeners normally use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved salt chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are seriously damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
