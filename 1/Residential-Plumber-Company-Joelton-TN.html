The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To maintain your safety, home, and health convenience, we utilize just the best piping: polyethylene.
