<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
