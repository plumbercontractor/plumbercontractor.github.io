The minerals that cause tough water adhere to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>

The maintenance necessary for your hot water heater depends upon location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and producer suggestions. Seek advice from your local Roto-Rooter plumber to develop a water heater maintenance schedule that will take full advantage of the life of your device.</p>
