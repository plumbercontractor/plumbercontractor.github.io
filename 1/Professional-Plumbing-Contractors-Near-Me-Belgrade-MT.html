When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
