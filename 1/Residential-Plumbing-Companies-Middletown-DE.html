Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Beneath the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the snap ring by pulling it open and snapping into place.

But their added up-front costs indicate it pays to look before you leap.</p>
