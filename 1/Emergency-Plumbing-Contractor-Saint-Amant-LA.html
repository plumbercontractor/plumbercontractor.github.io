<p>Numerous house owners believe their utility companies or homeowners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the reality is that in a lot of cases you, the homeowner, are responsible. The majority of basic property owners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>In reality, that's how hard water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind.
