<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
