<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system.

<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more vulnerable and fragile to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and strains as an outcome of temperature change and ice development. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
