<p>The program achieves its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and policies for the building and construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a new hot water heater. However in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A water heater that is not set up properly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.
