It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old hot water heater.

<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or pull out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and might need additional costs. Since the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the clog, this is also not as efficient.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional options to the pricey copper piping.</p>
