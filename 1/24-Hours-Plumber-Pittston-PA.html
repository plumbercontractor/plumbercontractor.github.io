<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
