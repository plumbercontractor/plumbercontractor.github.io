<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. If your toilet is relatively new, you might need to change bathroom tissue or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
