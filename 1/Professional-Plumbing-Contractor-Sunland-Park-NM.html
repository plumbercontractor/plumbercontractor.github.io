Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
