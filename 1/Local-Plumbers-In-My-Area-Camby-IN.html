<p>There are a couple of choices when it comes to repairing a broken or stopping working sewer line. The ideal option for your home will depend upon a couple of aspects, including the age of your existing pipes, the degree of damage, and your budget. An approved backflow prevention device, which must be evaluated each year, must be installed on the service connection that the department has identified as having a capacity for backflow.</p>
