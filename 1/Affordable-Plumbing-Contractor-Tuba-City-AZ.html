<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply.

Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
