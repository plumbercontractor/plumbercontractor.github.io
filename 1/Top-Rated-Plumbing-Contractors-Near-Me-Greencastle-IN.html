<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body.

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Greencastle IN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
