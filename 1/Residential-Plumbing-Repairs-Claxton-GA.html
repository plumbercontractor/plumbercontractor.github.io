<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
