<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
