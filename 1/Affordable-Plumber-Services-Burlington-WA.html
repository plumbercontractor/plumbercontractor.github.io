<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Burlington WA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
