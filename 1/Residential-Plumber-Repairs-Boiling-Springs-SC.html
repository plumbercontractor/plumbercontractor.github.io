The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
