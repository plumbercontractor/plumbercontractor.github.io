<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
