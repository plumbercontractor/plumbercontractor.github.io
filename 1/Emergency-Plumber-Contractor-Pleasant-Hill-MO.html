<p>Imagine residing in a house with soft water-- a home where you do not have odd movies on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap easily, and do not need to worry about scaling on the inside or outside of your devices. Sounds great, does not it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water supply for houses, you can.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
