<p>Gas lines are vital for homes: they power stoves, hot water heater, and other home appliances to keep you dry, warm, and comfortable all year long.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper precautions if using one of these products.</p>
