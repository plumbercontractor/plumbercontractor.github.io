<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation in Rio Linda California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
