<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the solidity ions to speed up.

<p>Galvanized steel drinkable supply of water and circulation pipes are commonly discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service.

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
