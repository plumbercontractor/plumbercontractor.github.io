<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>We have two no-dig techniques to repair your sewer line: CIPP and pipe bursting. We total CIPP repairs with no excavation. Pipe breaking requires limited digging.
