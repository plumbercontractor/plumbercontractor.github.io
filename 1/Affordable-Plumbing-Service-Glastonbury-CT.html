One can be added for around $120 if you do not have actually one already installed nearby.

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer.
