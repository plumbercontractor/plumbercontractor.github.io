For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into situations, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task. Sometimes, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not safely operate and enter the basement up until the sewage is extracted and the basement is typically cleaned. I 'd love to post some photos of this. Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
