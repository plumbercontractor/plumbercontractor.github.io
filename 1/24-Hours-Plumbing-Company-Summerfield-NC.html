<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
