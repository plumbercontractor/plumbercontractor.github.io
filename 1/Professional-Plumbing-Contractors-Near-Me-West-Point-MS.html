<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. There are two basic piping materials used by plumbing specialists. PEX and copper both offer numerous benefits and advantages such as getting rid of the metal taste from your water.</p>
