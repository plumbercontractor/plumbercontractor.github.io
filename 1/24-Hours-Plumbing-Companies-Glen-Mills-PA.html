<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
