Residences integrated in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health hazards related to lead.</p>
<p>There's a great chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
