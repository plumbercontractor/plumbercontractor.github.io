For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
