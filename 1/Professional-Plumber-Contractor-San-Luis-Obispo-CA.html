Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
