<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
