<p>Particles such as foreign objects - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being trapped in between your drainpipe and your pipes. These will eventually block the circulation of your water prior to triggering a clog.

<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Traditionally, the savings have been based mainly on lowering chemical and detergent costs.
