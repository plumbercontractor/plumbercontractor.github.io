<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Henryetta OK</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten as required. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as desired.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is since there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty low-cost and easy to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, ultimately causing a backup. This added with other debris in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
