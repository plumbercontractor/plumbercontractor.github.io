Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit should use a grounded electric outlet for power. Currently purchased your heater and simply need it installed?
