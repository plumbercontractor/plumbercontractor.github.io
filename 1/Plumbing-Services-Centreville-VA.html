Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline type that will not hold on to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regrowth.</p>
