It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
