Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground no for clogs. As hair integrates with soap, it can produce the ideal storm for plumbing obstructions. Over time, these blockages can intensify and avoid your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.

The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
