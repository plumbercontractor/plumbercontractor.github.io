<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
