<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
