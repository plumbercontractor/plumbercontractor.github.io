<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
