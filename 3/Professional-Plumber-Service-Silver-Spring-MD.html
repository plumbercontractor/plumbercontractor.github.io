<p>It assists to know the brand and model of your toilet. The trademark name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the design or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can become a trial-and-error process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try two or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
