Hard water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
