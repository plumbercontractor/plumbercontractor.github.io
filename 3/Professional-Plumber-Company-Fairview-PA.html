Whether you select repiping or pipe lining it can be an intimidating decision and procedure, however we will be with you the entire method through.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
