<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with tough water, you may not realize how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Hard water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
