Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this might be serious issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house should have water. This opts for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working correctly, you are off to a great start.</p>
