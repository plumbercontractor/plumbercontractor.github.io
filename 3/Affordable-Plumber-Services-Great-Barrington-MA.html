<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. When the tap is switched on, tankless systems specifically make usage of a component that heats up water.
