This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective contaminants can then get in the drinkable water supply. The best way to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
