This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
