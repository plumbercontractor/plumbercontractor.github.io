<p>Backpressure might happen when the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not correctly safeguarded.</p>

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
