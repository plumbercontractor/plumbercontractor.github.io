<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Old Saybrook CT</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for a lot of fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can happen.</p>
