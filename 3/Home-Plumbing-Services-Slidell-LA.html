<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
