Discovering a skilled plumber who is sure to not just do the right job, however to do it efficiently, is the very best possible investment you can make during this process.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
