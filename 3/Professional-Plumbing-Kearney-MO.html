<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
