<p>If it ends up being tough to turn; it's most likely you've encountered an obstruction, turn the handle counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain until you strike resistance again, then turn the handle back and forth to work a few of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out regularly to eliminate debris up until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a property owner.

You need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is happening to your home.</p>
