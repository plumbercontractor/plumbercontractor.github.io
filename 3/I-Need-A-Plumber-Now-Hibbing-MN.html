<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
