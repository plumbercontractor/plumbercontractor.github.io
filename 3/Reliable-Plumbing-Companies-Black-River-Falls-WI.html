<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each location where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, anybody who sets up gas piping on property not under their ownership need to possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a license and inspection.</p>
