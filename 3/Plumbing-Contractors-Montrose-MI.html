<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
