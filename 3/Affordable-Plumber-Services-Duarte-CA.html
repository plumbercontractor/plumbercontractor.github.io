<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company supplies include double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.
