High water pressure results in leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without proper pressure decrease.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
