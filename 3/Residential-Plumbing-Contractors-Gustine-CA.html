<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic gadgets can be effective in avoiding scale development in tough water supply. It is really challenging to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well enough explained to permit others to examine them and to confirm the outcomes.
