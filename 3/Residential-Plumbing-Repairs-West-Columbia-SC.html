<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Gas lines are vital for families: they power stoves, hot water heater, and other home appliances to keep you dry, warm, and comfortable all year long. Nevertheless, your gas line also carries naturally unpredictable elements that can be unsafe if not handled correctly. Time and use rust gas lines, making them more susceptible to cracks and breaks. At American Leak Detection, our skilled team of gas leak professionals have extensive training and certification to repair and locate gas leaks.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a mindful cleaning.</p>
