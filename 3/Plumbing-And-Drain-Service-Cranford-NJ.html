<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
