<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary clogs further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of impurities and will need to be changed. (This need to not hold true if the resin is occasionally regrowed and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealer for details on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's smart to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
