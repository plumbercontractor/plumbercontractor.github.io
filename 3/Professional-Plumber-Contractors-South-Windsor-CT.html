When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
