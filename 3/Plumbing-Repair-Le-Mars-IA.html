<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted effectively (Image 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
