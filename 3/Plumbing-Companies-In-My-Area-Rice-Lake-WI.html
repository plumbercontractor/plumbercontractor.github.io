<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller design that operated on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
