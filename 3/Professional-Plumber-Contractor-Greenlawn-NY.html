<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
