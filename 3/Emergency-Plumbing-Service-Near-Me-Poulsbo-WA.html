<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
