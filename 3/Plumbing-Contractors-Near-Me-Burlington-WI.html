<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with tough water, you might not understand just how much it impacts you-- but if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Tough water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
