Tough water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
