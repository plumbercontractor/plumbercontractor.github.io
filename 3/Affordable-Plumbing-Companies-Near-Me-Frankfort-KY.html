Some water heater problems are minor adequate to be effectively attended to with professional repairs.

Nevertheless, particular issues with your water heater might indicate that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can assist you figure out which course of action is best for you.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
