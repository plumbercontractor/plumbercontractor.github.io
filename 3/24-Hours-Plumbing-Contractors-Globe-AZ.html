<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Globe AZ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>You hear water leaking or running in the tank. When water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow takes place. The water streaming backwards from a cross-connection may infect the drinking water system. Lawn watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.
