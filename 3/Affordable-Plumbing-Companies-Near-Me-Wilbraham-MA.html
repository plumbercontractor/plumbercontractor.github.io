<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
