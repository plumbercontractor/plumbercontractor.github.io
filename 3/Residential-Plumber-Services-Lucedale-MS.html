<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water supply because it can spread out polluted water back through a circulation system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or potential connection in between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or impurities to get in the potable water system.

<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
