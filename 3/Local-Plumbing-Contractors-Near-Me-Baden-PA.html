<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket below the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in location. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
