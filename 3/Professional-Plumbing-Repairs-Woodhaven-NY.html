Sediment Build-Up: If you discover strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
