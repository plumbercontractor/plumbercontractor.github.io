<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Pooler GA</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten as necessary. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as desired.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
