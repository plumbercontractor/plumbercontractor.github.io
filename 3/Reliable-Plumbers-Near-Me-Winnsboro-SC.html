The reasons for this can range from leaks, defective or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed concerns, a repair or replacement of the components may be adequate. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems occurring often, then a hot water heater replacement is required.</p>
