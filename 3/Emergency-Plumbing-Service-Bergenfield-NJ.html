<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
