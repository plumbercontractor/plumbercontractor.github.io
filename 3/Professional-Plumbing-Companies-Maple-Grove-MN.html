<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
