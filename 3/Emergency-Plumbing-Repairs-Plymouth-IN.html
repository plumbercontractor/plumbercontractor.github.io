<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>To make it easy, property owners with testable backflow gadgets are supposed to have them evaluated by a certified tester yearly. The most common testable backflow device discovered at Minnesota homes is a pressure vacuum breaker, which is a device that is found on almost every residential yard irrigation system (aka lawn sprinkler), revealed listed below.</p>
