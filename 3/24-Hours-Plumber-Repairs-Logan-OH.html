<p>When seeking a gas line installation in Dallas, therefore, you need to use well-trained and certified experts for all elements of your plumbing and gas line installation. When your plumber has installed a gas line, you'll want an audit of the plumbing and installation to ensure that there are no gas leakages. This need to be done before the plumber leaves the task. The audit will decrease the chances of a gas leak. Shut off the gas valves right away if you do notice a pungent odor in your home after your plumber leaves. Evacuate the building and make sure that open fire does not get near your home up until a professional can fix the gas leak. Contact your gas utility company immediately.</p>
