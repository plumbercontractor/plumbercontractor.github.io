During regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>In many cases, a gas line might be covered if it is ruptured. This type of scenario might take place if a contractor is dealing with an individual's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line.
