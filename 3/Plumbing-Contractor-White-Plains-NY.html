<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and might in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is in fact a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home. Once the brand-new salt has actually had an opportunity to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
