<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
