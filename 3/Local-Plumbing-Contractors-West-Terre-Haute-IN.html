Checking the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
