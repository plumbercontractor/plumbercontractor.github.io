And once the work is completed, you'll see a big improvement in your house: fewer obstructions, no water damage, lower water costs. The new plumbing must be there doing its job for years.</p>

A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
