<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for many building contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the factor you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.
