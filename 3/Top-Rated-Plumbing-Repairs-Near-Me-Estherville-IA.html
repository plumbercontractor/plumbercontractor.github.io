It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.

If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
