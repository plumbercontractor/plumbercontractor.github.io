<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is utilized to express the intensity of the acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up deterioration Co2 will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, therefore making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
