Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
