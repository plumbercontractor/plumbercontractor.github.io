The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
