<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully because tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to utilize more and more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
