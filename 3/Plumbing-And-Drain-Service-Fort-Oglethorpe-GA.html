Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
