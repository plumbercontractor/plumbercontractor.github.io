Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

When the water is extremely hard and it is used heavily, the costs of softening will rise.</p>
