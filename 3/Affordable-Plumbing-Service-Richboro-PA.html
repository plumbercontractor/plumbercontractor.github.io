<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Richboro PA</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>This is constantly the # 1 priority for any legitimate professional. Plumbing can be a harmful job, and can negatively impact everybody living in the home when finished poorly. There is specifically no exception for dealing with toilets. If incorrectly dealt with, your toilet's inadequacy could result in burst pipes, supported sewer lines, and even increased toxicity in the area. Obviously, the majority of those situations are only results of cases of extreme neglect, but you can never be too cautious with the plumber you pick. Ensure you select a plumbing company with a reputation for safety.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
