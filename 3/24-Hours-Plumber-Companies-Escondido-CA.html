<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized.
