<p>Carbon monoxide is released when gas burns incompletely. The symptoms are the same as exposure to gas leakage. The direct exposure to carbon monoxide is so fatal that anyone who inhales it needs immediate medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 people passed away from carbon monoxide poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this catastrophe, make sure to use your gas stoves exactly as instructed and never ever to use them to warm your house. The same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be utilized outdoors only and not inside. When running the space-heaters, ensure somebody is awake to monitor them. Many families die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning overnight. Another preventative measure to take is to never ever run your generators in enclosed areas. Constantly, always make certain to call professionals for gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
