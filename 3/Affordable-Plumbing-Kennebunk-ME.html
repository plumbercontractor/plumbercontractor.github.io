<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of trash does not need to go in the garbage can.

By installing a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other disposing locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
