<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
