<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can take place gradually from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog becomes larger in time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes correctly.

<p>Lots of homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their filthy or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and affordable, but they harm your pipes and their impacts are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use extreme chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly suggested.</p>
