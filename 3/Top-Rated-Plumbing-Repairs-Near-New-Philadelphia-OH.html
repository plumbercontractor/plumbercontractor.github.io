Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
