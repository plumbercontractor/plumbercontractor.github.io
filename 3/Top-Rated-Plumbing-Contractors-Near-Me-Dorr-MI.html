<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
