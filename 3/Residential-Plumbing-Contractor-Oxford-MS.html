<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Oxford MS 38655</h3>

Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
