<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the potable system supplying the make-up water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective contaminants can then go into the potable water supply.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
