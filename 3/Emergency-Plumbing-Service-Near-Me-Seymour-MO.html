<p>Depending on your water quality, some softeners may be able to completely or partly remove copper, radium, iron, and manganese, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Note that copper can reenter the water after if passes and leaves the softener through your home's pipes and plumbing.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
