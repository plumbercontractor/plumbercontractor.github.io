<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
