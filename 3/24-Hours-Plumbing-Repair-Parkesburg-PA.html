<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Were you to ask the majority of people what word first comes to mind when they think about a plumbing system, pipe" would definitely be near the top of the list. The pipe is, after all, something of a fundamental foundation of any plumbing system.
