Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
