<p>While battling a fire, firemens are naturally more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to accomplish their goal, however fire department lorries often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>If you have actually ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your meals that will not disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll be happy to understand that water softening can eliminate these problems and more. Difficult water triggers these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to stress over any issues with mineral deposits remaining. This makes chores easier and less frustrating for everybody involved.</p>
