Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
