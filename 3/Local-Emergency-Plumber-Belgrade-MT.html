<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Use the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free.
