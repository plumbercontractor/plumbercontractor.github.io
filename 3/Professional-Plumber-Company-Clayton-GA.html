Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange occur?

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Repair: Any problem involving the flush handle typically consists of a repair that plumbers can carry out easily. If the toilet doesn't flush, the handle might need to be tightened, or the chain might need to be changed or reattached. In many cases, you'll need to replace a flapper or the handle and its lever.

<p>Our group is committed to providing customers with only the very best plumbing services to keep families running effortlessly. Avoid tough water from damaging your toilet and bathroom plumbing. Sodium ions also have a favorable charge, but it is weaker, so when they are flushed through the tank with the calcium and magnesium ions, they press them out of the water. After the process is complete, you end up with soft water that has salt in it but no other minerals.</p>

<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Clayton GA 30525</h3>

Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your system is at the end of its life expectancy, particularly if they are causing major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it instantly becomes a serious safety threat. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it could trigger a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside ends up being ignited.
