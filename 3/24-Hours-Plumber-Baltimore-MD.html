<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
