<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
