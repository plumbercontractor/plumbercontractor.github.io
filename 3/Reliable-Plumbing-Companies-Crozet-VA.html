Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Often brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
