<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
