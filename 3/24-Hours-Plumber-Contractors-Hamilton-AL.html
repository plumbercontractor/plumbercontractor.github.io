<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
