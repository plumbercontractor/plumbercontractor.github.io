<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
