<p>Gas leaks are typically found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that allows connections and disconnections of gas devices. A quick way to detect a gas leak is if you apply liquid dish soap to the presumed area. You likely have a gas leak and ought to immediately get in touch with a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair if it bubbles.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
