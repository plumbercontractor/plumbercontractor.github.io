<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes.

<p>The best method to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by installing a pressure reducing valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters into the home. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the home will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>
