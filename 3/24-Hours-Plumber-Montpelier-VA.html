<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn.
