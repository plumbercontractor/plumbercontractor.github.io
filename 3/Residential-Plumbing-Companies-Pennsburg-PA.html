<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
