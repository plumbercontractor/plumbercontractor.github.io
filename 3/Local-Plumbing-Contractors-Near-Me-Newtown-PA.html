As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
