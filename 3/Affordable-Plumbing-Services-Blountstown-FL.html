<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
