<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions make sure the safety, security and constant efficiency of research study, vacuum, and industrial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure involves covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leaks and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the inside of the pipe and the material streaming through it. This repair technique is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
