<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with known backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Cost of associated materials and products usually required to install garbage disposal including: adapters, fittings and mounting hardware. You can save money.
