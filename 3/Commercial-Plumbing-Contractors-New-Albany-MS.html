<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the service is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to solve the concern. Other times a more substantial service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Another difference between hard and soft water is dullness of your hair and clothing. If you have hard water, your hair may feel dull and lack body, and your clothes will start to fade and might wear out earlier.
