<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician turned off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to remove the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The client assisted our technician in moving the toilet back into its correct place, and the service technician tightened up the bolts prior to bring back the water supply and guaranteeing that the toilet was appropriately flushing.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The absence of warm water is the most significant indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting sufficient warm water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has developed in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. If your water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to consult the experts.</p>
