<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Hanover NH</h3>
<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in avoiding scale formation in hard water systems. It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well enough explained to allow others to assess them and to verify the outcomes. While the lack of "clinical" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it ought to make one be reluctant to accept it without some assurance of efficiency.</p>
<p>Was your home built prior to the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has worn away and decomposed over the years. Older pipes can trigger major leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>
