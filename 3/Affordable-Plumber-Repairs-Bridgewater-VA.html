<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are naturally more worried about drawing enough water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to accomplish their goal, but fire department cars often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread out significantly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in individual homes, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>
