<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Denton MD 21629</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
