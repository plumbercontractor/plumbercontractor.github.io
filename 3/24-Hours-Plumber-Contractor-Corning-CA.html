<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you should initially get the required license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can have a look at our License page to find out more on obtaining a license. As soon as you obtain an authorization you can commence with the work. Nevertheless, you must call for inspection before you cover or conceal any work.</p>
