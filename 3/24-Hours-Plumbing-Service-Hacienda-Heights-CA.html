<p>Inspecting the water, age, and condition lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers understand many things, including water pressure and indications of leaks. If the hot water heater has been kept with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to prospective contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
