Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
