<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable option, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
