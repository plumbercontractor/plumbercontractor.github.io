<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician shut off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
