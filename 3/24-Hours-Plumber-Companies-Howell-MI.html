Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
