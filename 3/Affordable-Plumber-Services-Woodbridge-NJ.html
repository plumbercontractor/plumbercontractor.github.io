<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
