<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Marina CA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
