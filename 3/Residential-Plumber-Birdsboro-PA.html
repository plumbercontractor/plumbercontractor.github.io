<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
