<p>One typical method for a home's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
