<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Astoria OR</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Was your home built before the 1970s and has not undergone renovation or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has rusted and decomposed over the years if so. Older pipes can cause significant leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>
