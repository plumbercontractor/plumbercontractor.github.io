<h3>Leaky Faucets in Charlottesville VA 22903 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>

<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
