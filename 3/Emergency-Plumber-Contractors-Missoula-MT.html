<p>Toilet repair is one of the most common plumbing repairs performed in houses today. This is most likely due to the truth that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the huge number of toilets, we have actually fixed many toilets in homes throughout the Tampa area so we are extremely familiar with the items used and how they are installed here locally. We also have done lots of toilet replacements also; this is normally required when either a resident chooses to replace their toilet with possibly a more efficient one or when a toilet is just beyond repair.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they used to be. Nowadays, property owners can pick from a dizzying series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, energy room, and more. In the bathroom, you might have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is usually an indication of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the blockage isn't eliminated, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually triggering it to burst.</p>
