Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
