<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Halethorpe MD</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for the majority of fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
