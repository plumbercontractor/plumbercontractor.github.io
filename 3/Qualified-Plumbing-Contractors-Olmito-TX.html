How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to initially acquire the needed permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for more details on getting an authorization. As soon as you obtain an authorization you can start with the work. However, you should require inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
