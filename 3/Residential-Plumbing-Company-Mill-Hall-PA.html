<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
