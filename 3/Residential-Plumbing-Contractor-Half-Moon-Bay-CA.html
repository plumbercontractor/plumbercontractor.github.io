<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company supplies include check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. Also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
<p>There are 2 main kinds of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and decreased pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that each person uses around 80-100 gallons of water a day.
