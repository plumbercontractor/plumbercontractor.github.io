<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).

The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
