<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
