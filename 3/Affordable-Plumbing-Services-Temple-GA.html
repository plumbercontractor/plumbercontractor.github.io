Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger clogs and jams - think about composting or placing these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain also. After finishing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside.
