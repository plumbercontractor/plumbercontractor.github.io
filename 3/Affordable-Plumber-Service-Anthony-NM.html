The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the fundamental style of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or static flow condition might cause nuisance dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
