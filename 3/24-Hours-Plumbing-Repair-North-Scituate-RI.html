This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity.
