<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
