<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home, this is one of the main and first questions that you should ask yourself. The age of your house is a critical component to understand whether or not you must repipe your home. This is not just because your plumbing has actually aged with time, but also since homes that were constructed prior to a certain period are most likely to contain galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was developed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was developed decades prior to that, chances are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>

They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
