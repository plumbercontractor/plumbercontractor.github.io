To avoid the headache of clogged drains, overflowing toilets, and backed-up sewer lines, it is essential to have routine, preventative maintenance carried out by a certified Chicago sewer and drain professional.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
