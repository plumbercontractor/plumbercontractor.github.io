<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a safe and stable  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
