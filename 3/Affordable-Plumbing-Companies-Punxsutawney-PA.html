<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Punxsutawney PA</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these negative effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers natural gas a smell frequently associated with rotten eggs. This distinctive aroma allows you to smell a possible leak if it takes place. Constantly leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
