The pipe lining procedure includes our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes. When the procedure is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
