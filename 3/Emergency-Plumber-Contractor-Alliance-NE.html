<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to wear away and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
