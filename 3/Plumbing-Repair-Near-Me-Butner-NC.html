<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
