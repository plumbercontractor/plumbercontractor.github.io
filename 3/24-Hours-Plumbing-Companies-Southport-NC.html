<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Southport NC 28461</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
