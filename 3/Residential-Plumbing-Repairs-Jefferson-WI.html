Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
