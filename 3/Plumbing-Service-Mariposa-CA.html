Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
