<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
