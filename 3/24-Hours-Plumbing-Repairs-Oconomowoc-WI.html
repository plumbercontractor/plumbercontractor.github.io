<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of trash does not need to go in the garbage can.

By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
