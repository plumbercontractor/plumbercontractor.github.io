<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and duty are incredibly essential to building a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water system within a structure these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
