Research has shown no change takes place in the chemical and physical residential or commercial properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the devices (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
