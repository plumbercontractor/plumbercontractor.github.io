<p>One common way for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue could spread tremendously. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual houses, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Low pH likewise increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to reveal the strength of the level of acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
