<p>There are certain plumbers who specialize in plumbing connected with home improvement and brand-new building. When a new house is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber may be an excellent candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more customized plumber must be used for home renovating work.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
