<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
