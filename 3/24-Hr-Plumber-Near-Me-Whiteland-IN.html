<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
