<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally kept at a considerable pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
