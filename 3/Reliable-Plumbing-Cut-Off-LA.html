Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property.
