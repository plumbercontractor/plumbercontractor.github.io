<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Thomasville NC</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is simply the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, sometimes in concrete. It is rather typical to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The brand-new pipe is just set up in the path of least resistance. Depending upon the style of your house, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>
