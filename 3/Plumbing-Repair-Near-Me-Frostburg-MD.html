<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Think of all the locations water flows in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional assessment must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines need to be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive special attention, a knowledgeable plumber wants to take a look at the complete health of your system. That means testing for proper water pressure.

<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.
