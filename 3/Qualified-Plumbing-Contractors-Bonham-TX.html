<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
