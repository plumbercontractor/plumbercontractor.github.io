<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
