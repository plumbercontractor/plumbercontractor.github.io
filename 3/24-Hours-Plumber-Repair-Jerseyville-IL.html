<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.

We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
