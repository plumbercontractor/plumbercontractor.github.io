Applications vary from softening in remote locations to dealing with concerns of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given in horse power, or HP. These correspond directly to just how much waste the system can manage, and recommended sizes are typically based upon how many users remain in a household.

Setups should only be carried out by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
