<p>When selecting, ask for proof of a license.

As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Ensure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
