<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than useful, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, including both water supply and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe deserves the investment in the long run because it may attend to the root cause of the chronic plumbing problems in your home.</p>

Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
