<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
