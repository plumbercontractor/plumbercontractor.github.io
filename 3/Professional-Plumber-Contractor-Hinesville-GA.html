Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
