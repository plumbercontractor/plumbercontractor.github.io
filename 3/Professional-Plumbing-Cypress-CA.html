<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
