<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Wayzata MN</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
