<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise cause jams and blockages - consider composting or placing these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can collect and congeal in your drain as well.
