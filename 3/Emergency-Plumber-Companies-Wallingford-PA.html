<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Wallingford PA</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water pipe are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
