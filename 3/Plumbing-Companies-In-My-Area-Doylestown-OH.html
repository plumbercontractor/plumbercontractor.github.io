<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.
