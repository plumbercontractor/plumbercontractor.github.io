<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

And these distinctions dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
