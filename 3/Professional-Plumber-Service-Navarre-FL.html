<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
