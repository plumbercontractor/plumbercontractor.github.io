<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
