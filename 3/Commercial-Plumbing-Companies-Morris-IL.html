<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to address this concern. Call a plumber right away.</p>
