<p>Surface Area Accelerated Formation is a creation that imitates biomineralization, the system frequently recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely remove momentary solidity in water.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
