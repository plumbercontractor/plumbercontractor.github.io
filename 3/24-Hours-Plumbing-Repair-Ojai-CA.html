<p>Work of plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters is predicted to grow 14 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all professions.

<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents pollutants or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Numerous sprinkling systems already have the correct backflow preventer set up and need only be tested each year. Others might not meet state and local guidelines and might need to be replaced with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
