<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is produced. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then get in the drinkable water system. The very best way to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company supplies include check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and decreased pressure zone assemblies.
