Chicago Gas Lines focuses on natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, home appliances, heaters, generators & gas lights. When no other source of a leak can be determined, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
