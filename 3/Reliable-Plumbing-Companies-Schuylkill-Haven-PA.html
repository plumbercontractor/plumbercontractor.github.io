Multiple back-ups typically suggest your sewer system is failing. We advise following up with a complete video inspection of the whole system to identify what is triggering the issue and to figure out whether it will be a recurring issue.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
