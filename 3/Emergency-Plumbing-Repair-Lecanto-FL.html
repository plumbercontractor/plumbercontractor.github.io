<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be installed need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to authorize and process. Turned down plans need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can add another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal system will need can differ depending on how typically it's used, its age, and the type of products you're putting in it.
