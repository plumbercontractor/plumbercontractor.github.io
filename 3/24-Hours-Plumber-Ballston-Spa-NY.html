<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system offering the make-up water. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential contaminants can then enter the potable water supply. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
