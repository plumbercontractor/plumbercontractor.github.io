Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
