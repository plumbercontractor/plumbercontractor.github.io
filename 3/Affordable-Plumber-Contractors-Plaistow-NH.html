Repiping is the procedure of replacing old rusty pipes with long lasting and lasting new pipes. Due to the fact that of their resilience and other aspects, the new pipes that are used are generally made of copper. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
