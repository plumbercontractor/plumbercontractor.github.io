<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing offered outstanding service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not just was he comprehensive and exceptionally professional however he was able to respond to all my questions worrying the service. I would provide 6 stars if I could. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is among the most effective methods of finding the exact location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will place a specially developed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to figure out where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
