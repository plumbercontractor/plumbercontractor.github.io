If you smell a strong whiff of gas from your automobile when it is running, you may have a gas leak from the fuel line. It is necessary to repair this immediately to prevent an explosion. If you are not certain of your repair abilities, it is best to take your car to a certified mechanic.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When you call throughout our standard service hours, we can have an experienced professional to your home within the hour. If you believe your plumbing is breaking down, or you're currently facing a plumbing problem, do not hesitate to call our emergency response service to experience reliable, top quality services supplied by our experts at Bob Oates Plumbing, Sewer, & Rooter today.</p>
