Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
