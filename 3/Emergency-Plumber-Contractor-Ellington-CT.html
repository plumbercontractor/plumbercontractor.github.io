<p>No, you ought to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Ellington CT</h3>
<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than just a costly repair-- they can result in comprehensive and costly residential or commercial property damage and cause major health threats. When a sewer line stops working, sewer line repair is the first line of defense. Sewer line replacement is the only other choice if the sewer line can't be repaired. Fortunately, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a residence is since there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are simple and quite low-cost to install, so there's no reason not to. Eventually triggering a backup when grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and prevents water circulation. This added with other debris in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
