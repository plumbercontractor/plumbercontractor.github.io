<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>

<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not present a threat to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
