It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water.

When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
