<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Wallingford CT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is considered to not pose a danger to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
