For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly required, in some cases the plumber might need to update or repair wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+.
