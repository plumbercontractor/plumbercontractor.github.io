<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is by hand controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the service technician to accurately analyze conditions and identify the performance of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and suggest the best service too. If the pipe needs to be cleaned of blockages or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence.</p>
