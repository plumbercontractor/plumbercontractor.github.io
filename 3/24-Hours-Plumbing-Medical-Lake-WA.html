<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than simply a costly repair-- they can result in substantial and costly residential or commercial property damage and result in major health risks.

<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they used to be. Nowadays, property owners can select from a dizzying series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you might have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is normally an indication of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the clog isn't gotten rid of, water pressure can build up within the pipe, ultimately triggering it to burst.</p>
