Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
