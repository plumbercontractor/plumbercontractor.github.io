<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
