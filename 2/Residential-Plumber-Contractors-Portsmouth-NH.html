<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
