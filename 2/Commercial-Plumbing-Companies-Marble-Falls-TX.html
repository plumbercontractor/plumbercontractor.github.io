For home, it is essential for owners to inform the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates using each brand-new occupant. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made before water service is allowed.

Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Co2 will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
