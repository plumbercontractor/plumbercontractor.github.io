<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Sand Springs OK</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

However, while DCV systems are considered safe for a lot of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
