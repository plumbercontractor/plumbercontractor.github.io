<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dosage, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if hardness had an effect on cleaning agent savings. The research study consisted of tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to examining finding and recording. Scientists discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less cleaning agent, however cleans up in addition to water at 10 gpg hardness level.
