<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Wadsworth OH</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>To make it basic, homeowners with testable backflow gadgets are expected to have them checked by a certified tester each year. The most common testable backflow device discovered at Minnesota homes is a pressure vacuum breaker, which is a device that is found on nearly every residential yard irrigation system (aka lawn sprinkler), shown below.</p>
