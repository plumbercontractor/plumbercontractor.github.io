Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight equally and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
