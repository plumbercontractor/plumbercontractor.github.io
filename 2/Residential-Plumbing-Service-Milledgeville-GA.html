<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

The brine tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
