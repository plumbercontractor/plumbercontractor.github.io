During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

When washing items are used in hard water - hard water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water. Any place where water is included is prone to clogged drains. Your drainpipes are especially vulnerable to obstructions and other clogs because of the quantity of use they get and all the numerous things that we put down them.
