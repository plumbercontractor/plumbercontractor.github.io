<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public supply of water and private on-site water system and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections in between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
