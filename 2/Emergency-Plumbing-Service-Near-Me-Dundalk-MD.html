<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
