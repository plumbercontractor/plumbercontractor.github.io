<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Oakville CT</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
