<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may often leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is in fact a safe germs that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other 2 types of salts.

<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with waste disposal unit installation make the job potentially harmful. That makes it a great factor to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Homeowners can either buy the new disposal themselves and offer it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
