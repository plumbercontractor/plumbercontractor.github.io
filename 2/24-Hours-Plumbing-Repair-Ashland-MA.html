<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed properly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
