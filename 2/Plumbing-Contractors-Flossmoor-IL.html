<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

The info we obtain from the inspection enables us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and recommend the very best solution also.
