Examining the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be severe issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house ought to have water. This opts for every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a good start if whatever is working properly.</p>
<p>The sewer camera inspection allows you to in fact see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the material the drain line is made from. You can inform if the issue with your drain line remains in a particular area, or if the whole line or a portion of the sewer line needs replacing. If there is a break in the line, the camera not only confirms the location of the break but allows you to see the nature of the break, too. When preparing to link another sewer into the line, a camera can also be used to aesthetically inspect the condition of a sewer line. It can also be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need arises to confirm that a sewer remains in good condition.</p>
