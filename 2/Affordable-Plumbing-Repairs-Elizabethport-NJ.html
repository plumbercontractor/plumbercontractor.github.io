<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
