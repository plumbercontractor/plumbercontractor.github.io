A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan created to avoid the reversal of the flow of water once it has passed through the valve. The two kinds of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 very different products, but they both have amazing durability and longevity.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
