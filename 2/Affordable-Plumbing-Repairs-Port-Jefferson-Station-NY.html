For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
