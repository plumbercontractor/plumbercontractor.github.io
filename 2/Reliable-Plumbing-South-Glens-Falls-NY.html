If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you must wait until after the cycle is completed and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
