<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Duncan OK</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
