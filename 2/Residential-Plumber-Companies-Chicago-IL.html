<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your home.

When these parts break, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
