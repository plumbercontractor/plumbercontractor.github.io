<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet in the Kitchen in Cullowhee NC 28723</h3>
<p>If it ends up being tough to turn; it's likely you've come across a blockage, turn the handle counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Place it back into the drain until you strike resistance once again, then turn the handle backward and forward to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out occasionally to eliminate particles up until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly, we recommend that property owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.
