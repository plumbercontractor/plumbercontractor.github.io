If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. You ought to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
