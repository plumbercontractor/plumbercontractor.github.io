<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive option is required: repiping.</p>
