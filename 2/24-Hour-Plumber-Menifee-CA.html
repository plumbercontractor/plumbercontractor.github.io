<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller design that operated on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
