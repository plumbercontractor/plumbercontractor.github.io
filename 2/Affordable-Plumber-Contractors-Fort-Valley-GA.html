Homes built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes could seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks connected with lead.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or tarnished water, it generally signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
