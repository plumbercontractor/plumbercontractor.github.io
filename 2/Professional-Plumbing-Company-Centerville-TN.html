Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>Inspect the home's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and available for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of deterioration, request that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
