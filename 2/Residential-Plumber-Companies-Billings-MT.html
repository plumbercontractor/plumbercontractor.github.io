<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Billings MT 59102!</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation of water which might carry unclean water or other, dangerous substances into the public supply of water and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of situations that might draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regrowth. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
