<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
