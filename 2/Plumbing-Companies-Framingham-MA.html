<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Framingham MA 01702?</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items containing severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>When your hot water heater begins to lose its effectiveness, we are all set to step in and help. The typical hot water tank will last for 8-12 years so repairs or replacement is something that you must expect to handle a couple of times. When your water heater starts to leak, you need to install a new one fast. A clogged drain should never be ignored. A clogged drain can develop more costly damage if left ignored. Call us today for immediate service.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper safety measures if using among these items.</p>
