<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>You need to invest at least $50 to get a premium kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a durable surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use however requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
