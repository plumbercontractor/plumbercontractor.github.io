If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
