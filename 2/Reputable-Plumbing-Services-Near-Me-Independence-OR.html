It is extremely difficult to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based on tests that are well sufficient explained to permit others to evaluate them and to confirm the results.

Garbage disposals can weigh 15 lbs. or more. That's a great deal of weight to unexpectedly catch with one hand while you're turning the lower installing bracket with the other hand.</p>
<p>Typically triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, sometimes a defective fill valve might actuate periodically, as well. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create major drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
