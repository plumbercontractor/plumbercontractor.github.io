<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select should be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently noted should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of piping that are used in the repiping procedure. Since of their safety, cost and effectiveness, copper piping and PEX piping are used. Copper piping prevents bacteria from growing within the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both flexible and light-weight.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
