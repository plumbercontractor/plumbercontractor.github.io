<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
