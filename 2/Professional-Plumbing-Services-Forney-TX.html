If, state, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
