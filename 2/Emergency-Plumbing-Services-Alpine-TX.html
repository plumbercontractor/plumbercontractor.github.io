<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
