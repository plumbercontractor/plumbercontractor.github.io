<p>Any place water goes through home. This includes sinks, toilets, lines, pipes, and tubs. At this time, the pro will search for leakages and broken pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will inspect water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. He or she will eyeball visible pipes, and may run a camera inspection to check the pipes' condition from the inside.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
