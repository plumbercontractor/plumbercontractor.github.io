It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
