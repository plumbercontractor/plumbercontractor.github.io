<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
