<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs.
