<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Louisburg KS</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to schedule yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of obstructing or leaking. Test.
