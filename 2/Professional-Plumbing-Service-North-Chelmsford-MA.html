Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
