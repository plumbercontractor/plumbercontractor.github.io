<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service. When looking for a new flapper, your best alternative is to try and discover the exact same flapper that initially came with your existing flush valve. The simplest method to do that is by looking up your toilet design and choosing the flapper suggested for that design. If you don't understand your design number, however, we do offer an extensive choice of "will fit" flappers to help you out. See the video listed below for more information about the various kinds of flappers offered, or go to How To Replace Toilet Flappers for brief tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
<p>Checking the age, water, and condition lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leaks.
