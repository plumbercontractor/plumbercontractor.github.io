<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
