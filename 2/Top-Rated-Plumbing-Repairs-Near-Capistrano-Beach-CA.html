<p>While battling a fire, firemens are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any readily available source to achieve their objective, however fire department vehicles typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
