The pros at Perez Plumbing have the equipment, experience and understanding to quickly deal with any plumbing problem you may have.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
