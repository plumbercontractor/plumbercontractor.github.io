<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to provide years of protection. There are many regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all trigger the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may rarely need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your home. Even if the problem comes from with the community system, it's still clever to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your house.</p>

A plumber will insert a specially developed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video to determine where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this kind of camera to recognize and repair the drain issue. This type of camera is especially beneficial in locating a problem if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
