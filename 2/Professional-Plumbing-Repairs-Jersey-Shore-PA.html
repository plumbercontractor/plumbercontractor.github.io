<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process.

When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
