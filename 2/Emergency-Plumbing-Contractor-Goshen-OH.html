<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
