<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it also.</p>
