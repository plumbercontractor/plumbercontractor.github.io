<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
