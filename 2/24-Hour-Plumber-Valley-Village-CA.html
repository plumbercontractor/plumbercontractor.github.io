It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
