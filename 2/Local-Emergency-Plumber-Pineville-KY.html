<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where firmness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline kind that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regeneration.</p>
