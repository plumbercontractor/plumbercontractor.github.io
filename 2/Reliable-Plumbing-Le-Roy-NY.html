Chicago Gas Lines concentrates on gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, home appliances, heaters, generators & gas lights. When no other source of a leak can be identified, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will want to loosen the drain, and clean it thoroughly. If it is set in place, remove all of the previous plumber's putty by utilizing a scraper.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
