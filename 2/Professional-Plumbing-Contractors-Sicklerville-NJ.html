<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
