<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
