<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas.

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are included into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
