<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Altoona PA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
