<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually become worn and need to be changed.

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

When the water is really hard and it is utilized greatly, the costs of softening will rise.</p>
