Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
