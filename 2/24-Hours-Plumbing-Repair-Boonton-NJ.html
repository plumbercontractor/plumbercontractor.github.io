<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
