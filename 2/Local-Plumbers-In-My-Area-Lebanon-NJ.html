<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water hardness if you don't see limescale accumulation but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as successfully or your skin getting delicate and scratchy.

When linking the water lines, solder the copper fittings before you screw them to the tank so you don't warm the tank itself while soldering (Image 5).</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
