<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of keeping the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component. Running out of hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
