<p>If you need a water softener is a personal choice, determining. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
