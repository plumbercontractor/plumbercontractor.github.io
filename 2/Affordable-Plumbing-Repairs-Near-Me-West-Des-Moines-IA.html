<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>

<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.
