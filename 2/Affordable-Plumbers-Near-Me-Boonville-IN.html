Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
