Sediment Accumulation: If you see odd popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>

Sometimes, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not securely enter the basement and operate up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is usually cleaned. I 'd enjoy to post some photos of this. Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
