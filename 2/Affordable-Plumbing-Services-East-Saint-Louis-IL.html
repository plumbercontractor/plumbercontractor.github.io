<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
