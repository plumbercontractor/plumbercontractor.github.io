<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Service in Waverly</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
