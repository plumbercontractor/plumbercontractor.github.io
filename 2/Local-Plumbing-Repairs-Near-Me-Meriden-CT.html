<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
