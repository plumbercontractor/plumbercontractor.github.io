<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself.

Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
