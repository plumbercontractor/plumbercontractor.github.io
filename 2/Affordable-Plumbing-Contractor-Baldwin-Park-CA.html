<p>Gas leakages are commonly discovered at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that allows connections and disconnections of gas home appliances. A quick way to discover a gas leak is if you use liquid meal soap to the thought area. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and ought to immediately contact a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair.</p>
