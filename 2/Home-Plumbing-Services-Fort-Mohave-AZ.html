<h3>When To Call A Plumber Fort Mohave AZ</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
