Rather, our technicians use a breaking tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate. A new pipeline is instantly pulled in and completes deep space created by the old, burst pipe in a commercial or residential sewer. This repair method is usually utilized to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
