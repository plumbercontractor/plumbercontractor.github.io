Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.
