<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.
