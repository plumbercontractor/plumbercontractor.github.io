<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
