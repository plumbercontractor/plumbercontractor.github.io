<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or long-term connection between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances.
