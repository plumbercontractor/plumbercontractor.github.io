<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
