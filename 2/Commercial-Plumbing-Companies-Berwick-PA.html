<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
