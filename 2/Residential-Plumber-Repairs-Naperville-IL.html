<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building contractors (or their workers). The key to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
