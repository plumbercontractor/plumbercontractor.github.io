<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old.

This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
