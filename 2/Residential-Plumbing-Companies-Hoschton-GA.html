When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through.

This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out yearly forward flow tests are often viewed as a required to have them. However the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
