<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
