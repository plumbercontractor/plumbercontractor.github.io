<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
