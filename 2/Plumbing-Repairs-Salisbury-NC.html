Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and available for usage. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration, demand that a new one be installed.</p>
