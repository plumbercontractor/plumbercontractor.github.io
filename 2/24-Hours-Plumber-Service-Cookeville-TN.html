Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

The age of your home is an important part to understand whether you must repipe your house. This is not just because your plumbing has aged with time, but likewise because homes that were built prior to a particular time period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date worldwide of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your home was developed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was built years prior to that, possibilities are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>
