<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the three readily available approaches. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs in time.

During regrowth, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads.
