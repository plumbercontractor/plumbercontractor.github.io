<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Alexandria</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
