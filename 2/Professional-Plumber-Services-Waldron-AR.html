<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>If you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than regular (or perhaps more than when), this is a sign you might need a toilet repair or replacement.
