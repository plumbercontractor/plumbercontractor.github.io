<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
