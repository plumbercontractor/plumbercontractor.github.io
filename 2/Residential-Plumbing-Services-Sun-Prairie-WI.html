<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>When they have to suit local water and sewer capacities, Garbage disposal systems may cost more. The plumbing in your house should work well or backup can happen, and septic systems may need to be upgraded to work with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
<p>Though it's not always necessary, sometimes the plumber may need to upgrade or repair circuitry to power the new garbage disposal. This usually costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or greenery near the gas leak will be tarnished or degraded if the gas line is harmed. Contact our experts to identify the extent of the issue.</p>
