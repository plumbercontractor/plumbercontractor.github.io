<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
