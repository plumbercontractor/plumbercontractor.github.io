It covers interior, readily available, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas home appliances.

<p>You might be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the very same product as other pipes in your house, implying that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
