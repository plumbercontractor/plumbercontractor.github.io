<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten as needed. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as preferred.</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of the clog, we may use a range of various approaches, the most common being hydro-jetting.
