It is best to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic if you are not certain of your repair abilities.</p>
<p>Hot water is no longer a high-end-- it's a necessity. In Kingman, people utilize hot water for everything from doing the dishes to taking a relaxing shower, and even going one day without it presents a massive inconvenience. If you're having problems with your existing hot water heater-- or you need to get a new one-- don't try to handle it alone.  Call Plumbing by Jake.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or stained water, it generally represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>
