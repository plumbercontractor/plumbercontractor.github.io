A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
