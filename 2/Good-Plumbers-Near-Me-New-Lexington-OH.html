<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In New Lexington OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
