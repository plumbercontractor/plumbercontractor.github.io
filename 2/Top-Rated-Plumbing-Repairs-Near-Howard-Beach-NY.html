<p>Gas line repair can not be delayed. A gas line leak is possibly harmful and requires to be resolved rapidly. Furthermore, this repair requires that you work with a licensed plumber It is imperative that gas work, installation, refitting and all other elements are done by qualified professional plumbing contractors.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
