<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Checking the condition, age, and water lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers comprehend many things, consisting of water pressure and indications of leakages. If the water heater has been maintained with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic service warranty.
