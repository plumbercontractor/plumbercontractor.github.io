Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
