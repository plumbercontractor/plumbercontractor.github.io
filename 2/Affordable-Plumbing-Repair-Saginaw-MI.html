<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
