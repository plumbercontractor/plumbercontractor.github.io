<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough task due to the fact that of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
