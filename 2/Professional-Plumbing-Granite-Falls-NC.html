As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.

<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department should fulfill or go beyond the state requirements and carry the duty for enforcing them.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or long-term connection between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>In regards to the equipment that will be examined, there are 2 possible choices: a lowered pressure principle device or check valves. Both consist of a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were great at repairing the clogged drain, but really really sloppy about fixing the chip in the sink and using puddy under the sink.</p>
