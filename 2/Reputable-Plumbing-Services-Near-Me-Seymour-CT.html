<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
