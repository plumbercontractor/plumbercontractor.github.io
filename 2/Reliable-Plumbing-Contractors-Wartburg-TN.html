<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical solution, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
