<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on security within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in structures are linked properly, without any cross-connection to contaminate safe and clean water supply. Components should be properly caught, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a structures. Hot water heaters are also inspected to ensure that they have actually been set up correctly, to prevent a surge.</p>

The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
