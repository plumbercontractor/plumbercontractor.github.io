<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on security within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in structures are linked properly, without any cross-connection to contaminate safe and clean water supply. Components should be properly caught, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a structures. Hot water heaters are also inspected to ensure that they have actually been set up correctly, to prevent a surge.</p>
<p>Low pH likewise increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is utilized to reveal the strength of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will possibly contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
