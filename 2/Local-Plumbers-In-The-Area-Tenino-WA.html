Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
