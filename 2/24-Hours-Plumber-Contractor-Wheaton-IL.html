<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst.
