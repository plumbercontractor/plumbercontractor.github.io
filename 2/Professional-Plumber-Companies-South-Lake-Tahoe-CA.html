A toilet's tank is composed of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
