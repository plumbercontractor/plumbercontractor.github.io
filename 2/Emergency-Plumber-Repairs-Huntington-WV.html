<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer decades of defense. There are many regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
