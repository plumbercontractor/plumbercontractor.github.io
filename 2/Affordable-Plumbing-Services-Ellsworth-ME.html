<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
