<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
