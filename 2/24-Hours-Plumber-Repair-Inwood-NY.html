The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
