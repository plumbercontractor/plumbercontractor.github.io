<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
