<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right away. Before you can request an inspection, you need to initially get the needed authorization( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Authorization page to learn more on obtaining a license. As soon as you acquire a license you can begin with the work. However, you should require inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs.

Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a huge job - and it's a task you want to solve. But the range of plumbing pipe materials to select from can make it confusing.

<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
