<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the specialist to precisely examine conditions and detect the performance of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection allows us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and recommend the very best solution as well. If the pipe needs to be cleaned of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal suggestion with confidence.</p>
