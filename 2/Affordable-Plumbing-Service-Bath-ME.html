<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
