<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you may encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Double Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Do not get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI.

<p>Galvanized metal, is just an easier method of stating zinc coated" and what triggers galvanized pipes to rust is the exposure to excessive water and minerals. You may be believing that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your house's main source of water transport, and you would be appropriate. However, when the majority of these pipes were being installed, no one understood this was going to be the outcome. Luckily, there are a lot of other piping choices nowadays including copper.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
