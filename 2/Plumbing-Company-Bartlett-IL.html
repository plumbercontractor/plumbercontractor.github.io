<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm.
