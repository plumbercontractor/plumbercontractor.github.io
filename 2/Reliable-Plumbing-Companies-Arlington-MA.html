<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
