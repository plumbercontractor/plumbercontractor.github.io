You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
