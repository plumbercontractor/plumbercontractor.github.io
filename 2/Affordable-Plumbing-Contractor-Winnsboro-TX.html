<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
