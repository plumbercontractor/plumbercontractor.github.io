The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
