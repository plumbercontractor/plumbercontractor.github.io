Once it has actually passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement created to prevent the reversal of the circulation of water. The two kinds of pipes that we prefer to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 extremely different products, however they both have incredible resilience and durability.</p>
