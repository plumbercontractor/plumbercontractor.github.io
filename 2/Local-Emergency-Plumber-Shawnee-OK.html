<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately struggles with rust and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
