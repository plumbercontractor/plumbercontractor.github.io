<p>Faucets serve an useful purpose, and you want one that reaches conveniently into the sink bowl, minimizing the splash and spray that originate from a badly positioned, or too short, faucet arm.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
