<h3>Drain Cleaning Company in North Branch Minnesota</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cords as wanted.</p>
