<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth understanding about garbage disposal installation.

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
