Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth.
