<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new.

Examine the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
