Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
