<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Fayette AL</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
