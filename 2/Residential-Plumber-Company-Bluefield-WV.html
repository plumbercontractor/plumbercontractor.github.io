<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Bluefield WV 24701</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
