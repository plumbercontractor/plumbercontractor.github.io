<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically discovered before it causes any significant damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This little hole permits water to constantly leak out very gradually. Gradually it can lead to a substantial build of water. Leaked water typically stays under your house and saturates into the ground soil. This can potentially trigger a cavity if the house's foundation was not effectively compressed. This is an unusual event and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
