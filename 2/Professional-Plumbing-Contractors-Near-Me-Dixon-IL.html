<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Dixon</h2>

There is another device Hose Vacuum Breaker (HVB) which ought to be installed on all garden hose bibs to avoid contaminated yard water being absorbed to the drinking water system network. It is a small brass system that can be straight threaded on to the hose bib.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation.
