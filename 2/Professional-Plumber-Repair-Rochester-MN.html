Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
