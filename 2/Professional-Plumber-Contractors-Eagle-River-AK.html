<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
