And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
