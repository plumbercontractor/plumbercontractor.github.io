Secondary backflow approaches offer an increased level of defense for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs undergo preliminary and routine testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is likewise available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Info ).</p>

Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
