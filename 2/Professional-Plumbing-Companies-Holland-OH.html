<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct impact on your security, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Diane Heether is a city citizen of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener set up in her house.

Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan designed to avoid the turnaround of the circulation of water.

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
