<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
