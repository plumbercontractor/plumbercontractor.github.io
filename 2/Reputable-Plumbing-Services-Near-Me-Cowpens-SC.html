Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
