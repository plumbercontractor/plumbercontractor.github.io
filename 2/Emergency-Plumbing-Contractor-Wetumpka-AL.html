The need upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve is part of the unit for that specific reason. But while little drips ought to not be trigger for issue, homeowners should keep an eye on the water heater leaks. I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was friendly and professional. He also did the job faster than original estimated, so the work was less expensive than I prepared for. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
