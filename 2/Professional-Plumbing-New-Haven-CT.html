<p>Water system by the public utility contains some quantities of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional costs. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
