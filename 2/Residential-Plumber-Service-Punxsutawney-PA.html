<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be fixed by changing that area of damaged piping. Nevertheless, when the issue is found in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping. Couple of homeowners are thrilled with the concept of changing all their pipes, but managing the task prior to the plumbing system stops working permits you to prevent significant residential or commercial property damage.</p>
