<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
