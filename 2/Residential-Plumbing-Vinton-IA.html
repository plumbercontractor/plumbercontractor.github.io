Typically, relining your existing pipes is a better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near comprehensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, overall sewer excavation can cause a good deal of civilian casualties (and cost) to the surrounding area.</p>
