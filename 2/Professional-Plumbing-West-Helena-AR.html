Water conditioners do not efficiently remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

Instead, our technicians utilize a rupturing tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair method is usually used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
