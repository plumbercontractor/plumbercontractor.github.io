<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
