<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
