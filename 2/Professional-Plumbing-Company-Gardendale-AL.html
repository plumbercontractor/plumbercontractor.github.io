<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible service, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
