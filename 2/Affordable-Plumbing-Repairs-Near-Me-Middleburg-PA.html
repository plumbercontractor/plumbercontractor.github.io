<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

However the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
