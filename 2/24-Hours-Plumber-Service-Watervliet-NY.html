<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is especially prudent to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when buying a new house. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will likewise keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are germs that feed upon raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other typical clog-causers. This all-natural solution is safe and reliable. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to purchase our recommended enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
