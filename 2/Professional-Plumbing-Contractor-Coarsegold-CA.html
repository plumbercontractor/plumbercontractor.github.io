<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
