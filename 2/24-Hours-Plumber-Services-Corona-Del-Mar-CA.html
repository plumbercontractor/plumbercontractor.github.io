<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever. It has been in place since your house was built so it is about the same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and deterioration. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>Positive-Action Salt Water Valve - Snap-together building and construction removes use of solvents that might contaminate water. Favorable action helps prevent overfilling. In your home, a lot water washes through the drains, along with dirt, debris, hair, and other particles. Over time, this can all build up.
