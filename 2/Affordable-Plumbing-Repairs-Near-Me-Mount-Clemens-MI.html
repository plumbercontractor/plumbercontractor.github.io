If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
