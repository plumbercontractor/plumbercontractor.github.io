It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be supplied.</p>
