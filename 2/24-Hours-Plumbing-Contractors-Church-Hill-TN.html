<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Church Hill TN 37642</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place.

Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
