<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems.

The new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are eliminated to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending on the scope of work being carried out and the kind of structure, you may have several inspections.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
