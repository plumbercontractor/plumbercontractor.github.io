For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the property, enabling it to stream backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>Backpressure occurs when the pressure in a private water supply exceeds the pressure in the general public water circulation lines that can trigger typical circulation to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, including toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
