<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
