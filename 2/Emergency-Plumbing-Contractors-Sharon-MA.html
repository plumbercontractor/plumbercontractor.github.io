If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
