<p>There are certain plumbers who specialize in plumbing associated with house renovation and new building and construction. When a brand-new home is constructed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed properly and to local, state, and federal code.

All gas piping setups need an authorization and inspection.</p>
