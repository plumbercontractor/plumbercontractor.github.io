<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping.

The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
