<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise called tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would typically cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater extremely rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and scenarios that need backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is very important for owners to notify the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District reviews the use of each new occupant. If the existing backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made before water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the home owner.</p>

There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
