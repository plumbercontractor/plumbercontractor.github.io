<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and situations that require backflow prevention devices. For house, it is essential for owners to notify the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates making use of each new occupant. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made before water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the property or the renter owner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
