This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
