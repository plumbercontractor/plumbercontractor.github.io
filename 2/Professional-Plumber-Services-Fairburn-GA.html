<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a need more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers available that you might face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check".
