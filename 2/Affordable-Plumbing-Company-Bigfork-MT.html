<p>This is among the first and main questions that you must ask yourself when it pertains to repiping and changing plumbing in your home. The age of your home is a critical component to understand whether or not you should repipe your home. This is not just since your plumbing has aged with time, but likewise because homes that were developed prior to a particular time period are most likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was constructed prior to the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Chances are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at ideal rates if your home was constructed decades before that.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
