<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
