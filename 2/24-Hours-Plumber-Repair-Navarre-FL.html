<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low.

Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
